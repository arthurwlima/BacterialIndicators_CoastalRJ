# BacterialIndicators_CoastalRJ

Analysis of the abundance of bacterial indicators of feacal contamination in the coastal waters of Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, and in the Cagarras Islands.

Seawage from the southern zone of the city is discharged by an underwater outlet (30m), proximately 3km away from the recreational beaches of Ipanema and Leblon.

Seawage from the underwater outlet can reach the bottom waters close to the recreational beaches.

Enterococcus abundance in bottom waters

Seawater stratification is disrupted in winter months (June-Aug), when southwestern winds are more often

Measured seawater temperature in the bottom (Fundo) and surface waters (Sup). Data form the outlet is highlghted in red.

Disrupted water stratification and lower irradiance allows the feacal indicators to reach and persist in the surface waters

Enterococcus abundance in surface waters

The hypereutrophic Guanabara bay (P1) is another source of seawage to the coastal zone, although it is more likely that feacal indicators reaching the beaches comes from the underwater outlet.
